# Build Cute Bunny Display Widgets
For this assignment, build three different display directives for an image url: 
 1. The first directive should display the title of the image, the link (not the  actual image), and short description.  
 1. The second directive should display the image as a "thumbnail" (within a 100x100 pixel scale). 
 1. The third directive should display the title, the full-size image, and the description. 

You can use your own URL, or work with this cute bunny: http://f.cl.ly/items/3g3J1G0w122M360w380O/3726490195_f7cc75d377_o.jpg 

Create a sample page that loads all three different directives for a single hard-coded url, to demonstrate the distinctions between each display mode.
